== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=  How do I start? =
 After installing and activating the plugin, go to either the PayPal or Stripe page in the dashboard and setup the gateways you'd like to use. Next you'll need to arrange the form. Go to TotalDonations > campaigns > edit form > multi-campaign form. There you'll be able to add new fields and customize the form the way you need them. After you have set that up, head over to the 'email settings' page and set up your auto-reply 'thank yous' and the email addresses to notify upon a successful donation. 
 Once you have it set up correctly, paste the shortcode [totaldonations] inside the page you'd like the form to show up on and then run some tests. You can add as many campaigns and progress bars as you'd like.

= Are there any additional fees taken by you for using Stripe? = 
No, we charge you nothing to use Stripe or PayPal. All fees are from Stripe and PayPal are charged by each respective gateway. We do **not** take a cut.
